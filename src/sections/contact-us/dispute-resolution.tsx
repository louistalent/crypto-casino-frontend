                                The Customer Support Department will do its best to provide the customer with a reply or
                                solution within 48 hours from the customer’s query or complaint. In any case, however,
                                the outcome of the complaint will be communicated within a maximum of ten days from
                                receipt of the complaint. In exceptional circumstances wherein we feel that adequate
                                resolution of the complaint requires further investigation, GAMBLIX NV may extend the
                                timeframe by a further ten days. We shall inform you about this delay within the first
                                ten days of receipt of the complaint. In that case, we will also inform you about the
                                process, and possibly also put forward the necessary requests as deemed necessary. If
                                the client believes that his complaint has not been handled satisfactorily and would
                                like to appeal against GAMBLIX NV’s handling of the complaint, he may refer the dispute
                                to the Designated Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) entity (also referred to as ‘the
                                ADR’). The ADR will examine the circumstances of the dispute in order to decide the
                                outcome thereof. The designated ADR entity provides impartial ADR services for disputes
                                that have arisen between players and GAMBLIX NV, as the B2C operator in this case. The
                                ADR has been authorized by the Curacao Gaming Commission. In order to avail oneself of
                                this service, the player will need to adhere to the following guidelines: a. the player
                                needs to first ensure that he has tried to resolve the dispute via GAMBLIX NV’s internal
                                complaints procedure (as per section 8.1 above). It is only once this attempt has not
                                been fruitful that the ADR entity will take into consideration any ADR dispute form
                                submitted by a player; b. players may only resort to assistance from the ADR if the
                                dispute is not being or has not been handled by another ADR service provider, regulator,
                                or court. The ADR reserves the right to refuse any submission for review of a dispute if
                                it deems the latter to have been submitted to a third party, or if it considers such
                                request to be frivolous, vexatious, or does not relate to the outcome of a gambling
                                transaction (example, betting result, application of bonus offers, misleading terms and
                                conditions, or account management). It may also refuse to consider the dispute if in
                                doing so, the effective operation of the ADR would have been seriously impaired, or if
                                it feels that either of the parties has attempted to intimidate, threaten or exert undue
                                external pressure on the ADR process. A reply informing the parties that the ADR’s
                                refusal to deal with the dispute will be provided within three weeks of submission of
                                request; c. Once the Designated ADR tackles the dispute, the ADR’s outcome is considered
                                to be a binding decision vis-à-vis both the player and GAMBLIX NV. This therefore means
                                that players may only seek further legal and judicial recourse in regards to matters
                                allowed by applicable law. Such circumstances usually include, for instance, situations
                                where the ADR has acted in a serious manner contrary to the rules of impartiality and
                                equity according to law and such action has thereby prejudiced the player’s rights. It
                                is however being made clear that the procedure before an ADR entity does not restrict
                                the player’s right to bring proceedings against GAMBLIX NV in any court of competent
                                jurisdiction; d. With the exception of when a claim falls outside the competence of the
                                jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal in Curacao, GAMBLIX NV may offer the player
                                recourse to a form of non-binding dispute resolution, including mediation. At that
                                stage, the player would also need to be informed of the necessary recourse to obtain a
                                binding decision. For the purposes of clarity, claims of more than € 5,000 fall outside
                                the competence of the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal in Curacao.
